        "I decided to this because I think this is a great starting point, Kylie Ying is a great instructor, and I do wish to learn more about this field and therefore I begin my journey into ML through this. I hope, this venture of mine will lead to further courses and projects and I hope I can deliver on this promise to myself. I want to be a better person and better learner overall and move past all of my prior failures. I will not update this cell, any time in the future so if you or I open this file years down the line, probably will look at this with pride or regret, the former i certainly hope."
